--How To Use--
First add an object in 3D-view right panel, 'Proximity'> Add Object and choose object.
There are two modes, Proximity and Tension. Both modes only relate to the vertices within a single mesh and update on frame change or addon-parameter change.
Note: The updates don't occur in Edit Mode. All calculations are made on the unsubdivied mesh, using a subdiv modifier is OK but will be a bit slower.

Vertex Group values can be mapped to vertex colours using geometry nodes, attribute ramp node. From 'Your Vertex Group' to 'Your vertex Col'.

Proximity:
Assigns values to the threshold and ranged vertex groups. Only one groups is neccessary for output.

Threshold- Assigns a 0 OR 1 value to any vertex depending on whether the vertex is within the threshold distance from its closest neighbour.

Ranged- Adds an extra falloff useding the rangex parameter and uses 0 > 1 values.

Tension:
Assigns values to the threshold and ranged vertex groups. Only one groups is neccessary for output.

Threshold- Assigns a 0 OR 1 value to any vertex that is being displaced beyond threshold distance.

Ranged- Assigns values 0 > 1. These values are the normalised values of the displaced distances from threshold negative to threshold positive.
for example. A threshold of 0.05 will give a range from -0.05 to 0.05. If a point moves closer to it's neighbouring point, further than 0.05m, it is considered compressing and negative. 
If it is move away further than 0.05m it is stretching and postive. These values are then converted to 0-0.5-1

0-------------0.5-----------1
compressed  Neutral     Stretched

Filter: Choose a vertex group to limit calculations to certain points, this will improve perforamce on complex meshes. Any vertex that is assigned and has a weight of over 0.01 will be included.
