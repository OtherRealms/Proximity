First add an object in 3D-view right panel, 'Proximity'> Add Object and choose object.
There are two modes, Proximity and Tension. Both modes only relate to the vertices within a single mesh and update on frame change or addon-parameter change.
Note: The updates don't occur in Edit Mode.

Proximity:
Assigns values to the threshold and ranged vertex group. Only one groups is neccessary for output.
Threshold- Assigns a 0 or 1 value to any vertex depending on whether the vertex is within the threshold distance from its closest neighbour.
